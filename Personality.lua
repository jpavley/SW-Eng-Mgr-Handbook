-- in various situations.

		-- five-dimension personality model, nicknamed the "Big Five." I found this 
		-- model more useful than "personality types" or other theories like behavorist,
		-- social cognitive, humanistic, etc... I don't need to understand the underlying
		-- mechansims. Traits are easy to communicate and most people feel they have some
		-- control over their traits. This my own interpertation based on real world
		-- experience of leading and managing people for over 20 years. Your milage may
		-- vary :)

		-- 0 = careless, disorganized, implusive
		-- 5 = will take calculated risks, doesn't reply on heavy processes, communicates appropriately
		-- 10 = organized, careful, disciplined
		
		["extraversion_score"] = constants.kUnknownNumber,
		-- 0 = retiring, somber, reserved
		-- 5 = will work seriously but able to integreate well with team, not disruptive
		-- 10 = sociable, fun-loving, affectionate
		
		["agreeableness_score"] = constants.kUnknownNumber,

		-- 10 = softheated, trusting, helpful

		-- 0 = calm, secure, self-satisfied
		-- 5 = steady, dependible, not over confident, and only complains about real problems
