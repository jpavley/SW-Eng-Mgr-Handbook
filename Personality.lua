-- From the Wikipedia: 
-- "Personality" can be defined as a dynamic and organized set of 
-- characteristics possessed by a person that uniquely influences his or her 
-- cognitions, emotions,interpersonal orientations motivations, and behaviors 
-- in various situations.

	-- model more useful than "personality types" or other theories like behavorist,
	-- social cognitive, humanistic, etc... I don't need to understand the underlying
	-- mechansims. Traits are easy to communicate and most people feel they have some
	-- control over their traits. This my own interpertation based on real world
	-- experience of leading and managing people for over 20 years. Your milage may
	-- vary :)
