-- Represents Educational Background with a focus on "Higher Education"
-- From the Wikipedia:
-- Education in its general sense is a form of learning in which knowledge, 
-- skills, and habits of a group of people are transferred from one generation 
-- to the next through teaching, training, research, or simply through 
-- autodidacticism. Generally, it occurs through any experience that has a 
-- formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts.
-- Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or post secondary 
-- education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the 
-- completion of a school providing a secondary education, such as a high 
-- school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to 
-- include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational 
-- education and training. Colleges and universities are the main institutions 
-- that provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as 
-- tertiary institutions. Tertiary education generally results in the receipt 
-- of certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.
