-- Represents Work/Project History
-- From the Wikipedia:
-- Experience as a general concept comprises knowledge of or skill of some 
-- thing or some event gained through involvement in or exposure to that thing
-- or event. The history of the word experience aligns it closely with the 
-- concept of experiment. For example, the word experience could be used in a 
-- statement like: "I have experience in fishing".
-- The concept of experience generally refers to know-how or procedural 
-- knowledge, rather than propositional knowledge: on-the-job training rather 
-- than book-learning. Philosophers dub knowledge based on experience 
-- "empirical knowledge" or "a posteriori knowledge".
