	-- Represents Talents
	-- From the Wikipedia:
	-- An aptitude is a component of a competency to do a certain kind of work at 
	-- a certain level, which can also be considered "talent". Aptitudes may be 
	-- physical or mental. Aptitude is not knowledge, understanding, learned or 
	-- acquired abilities (skills) or attitude. The innate nature of aptitude is 
	-- in contrast to achievement, which represents knowledge or ability that is 
	-- gained.
